# Computational Demonology

Computational Demonology is the science of using math and algorithms to interact
with the fundamental fabric of reality, particularly the borders between universes. 

This app runs particular algorithms which a budding paranormal field agent might 
find useful.

This app is inspired by The Laundry Files, but doesn't implement anything from 
that (classified) archive.
